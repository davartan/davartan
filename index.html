                <i>This blog reflects my personal thoughts and experiences. They are written in my own capacity and do
                    not
                    represent the views or positions of my current or past employers, or any organization I am or have
                    been
                    connected to. </i> </br> </br>
                My main intention and motivation for writing this content is to share my thoughts, experiences, perhaps
                some articles about engineering, but most
                probably rants, because who knows, maybe someone will find things they can relate to. </br>
                At some points you might find that some of the writing is offensive, controversial, or just plain wrong.
                I might sound like a hypocrite at times - I might be one. </br>
                If anything here strikes a nerve or makes you feel compelled to reach out, and you do not know me
                personally, please don't do so. </br> </br>
                P.S. If the blog visually looks like something you've already seen, yep, I shamelessly forced AI to
                yoink the design from a different AI startup.
